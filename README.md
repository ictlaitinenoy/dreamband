# Dreamband - what this app is about

# ! ! ! DO NOTE THAT THIS IS WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND OFTEN IN A STATE OF NOT DOING ANYTHING CLEVER  ! ! !
## Background

The sole reason for the existence of this application is to demonstrate the technical skills of a freelancer consultant to potential customers. The whole concept of the functionality is kind of stupid and meaningless - it's just something that exist for the sake of allowing for the creation of a very simple Javascript SPA (single page application) and a Java Backend. 

### What does it do then

Basically you have 3 sections in the app - Bands, Players and Lineups. The Band section allows you to create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) bands. The Players section allows you to CRUD players. The Lineups section allows you to create/CRUD lineups of yours dreams and give brilliant names to these new bands! For example you could create a band called Total Awesomeness with Ronnie James Dio on the vocals, Adrian Smith and Zakk Wylde handling the guitars, Cliff Burton on bass and Vinnie Appice on drums. Oh. And Rick Wakeman on keyboards. And Tony Iommi on the guitars too. Well, you get the picture.

#### Architecture

The initial version will have a Spring DATA powered back-end with a RestController handling the JSON duties and a React.js front-end. In the future more stuff might be added just in order to gain exposure to more technologies in my studies, that is, some or all sections of the application might have alternative implementations with a different technology. Either that or I will create some different applications altogether, not really sure yet. In any case, the purpose here is to learn new technologies - not the creation of a killer app. Or even a complex one at that.
